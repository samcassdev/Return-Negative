# Return Negative

## Code Wars Coding Challenge

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes:
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

## Learned

In this challenged, I learned how to make the number in the function into a negative number by declaring that the number will return a negative number if it is greater than 0. After this, I called the function (num) to return the new negative value.
